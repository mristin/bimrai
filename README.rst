# BIMRAI
BIMRAI stands for "requirements architecture for AEC industry with BIM". We developed the requirements architecture to help us gather and specify software requirements in a structured manner within [the BIMprove project](https://www.buildup.eu/en/news/bimprove-h2020-project-disrupting-construction-industry).
